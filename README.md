<br>PERSONAL INFORMATION:<br>
<br>
<br>STUDENT EMAIL: S3889058@STUDENT.RMIT.EDU.AU<br>
<br>STUDENT NUMBER: S3889058<br>

<br>I am from Canberra, ACT where I have lived all my life. I am passionate about sport especially AFL and Cricket. I was so passionate that I started to study in the field of Sport and Exercise Science at the University of Canberra after completing certificates at the local Tafe, Canberra Institute of Technology. I made the decision to make a change from the University of Canberra where I was studying a bachelor’s degree to RMIT University in the field of Information technology (online) as it was more flexible with working full time and when I realised that sport was a hobby and not the career I wanted to proceed with. A fun fact about me is that through my passion for sport I learnt that I am ambidextrous.
<br>


<br>INTEREST IN IT:<br>

<br>The reason I am interested in Information Technology is that it is all around us. It connects us. As someone who is always using technology, it is fascinating to see how much technology as grown since I was a child from using corded controllers to wireless controllers and controllers that have feedback for the individual user. With the way Technology is evolving, there is no limit to how far it can reach, from simple things like phones to more complex things to Artificial Intelligence. These a just a few reasons why I am drawn into the field.<br>
One of the reasons that I chose RMIT is it has a fantastic reputation and was extremely flexible which was suitable to my lifestyle. As someone who works full time, flexibility is paramount to having a healthy work/life/study balance.
I decided to follow Information Technology because as someone who uses it every day, I would like a better understanding of the basic concepts that surround it and generally expand my current knowledge.
<br>I expect to learn a variety of different content related to Information Technologies such as programming and in general expand my knowledge of Information Technology.

<br>Learning Style Test: VISUAL<br>

<br>Personally, I do not read too much into the results as I they do vary each time you do them. I also find some people may not answer truthfully so the results can get skewed a little bit. I do tend to agree with my results I find I am more a visual learner and that I can be more assertive in certain situations.
I do not think that these results will hugely influence my behavior in a team environment as I think if you are respectful and clear it is a lot easier to be part of the team and can reduce miss communication.
In factoring in these results, I think it is paramount that there is clear communication and common goals.<br>

<br>PROJECT IDEA: AUTOMATED CALENDAR SCHEDULING/REMINDER<br>

<br>Overview:<br>

<br>Automated calendar scheduling: Taking data from emails and messages to automatically add events to your calendar and remind you on the day of the event. Currently you have to add things to your calendar instead of it automatically updating to your calendar. With automated calendar scheduling it would add things automatically. For example, a friend might ask you out to dinner for Friday next week. This app would automatically add it to your calendar if you said yes as a reply.

<br>Motivation:<br>

<br>I believe this would be an interesting concept as I personally always forget when I have agreed to plans. This app would help many people keep on top of when you have made plans. Currently I have to add events into my calendar and manually enter when I would like to be reminded. There is a gigantic market for scheduling apps and tools, from the home to the office there are a lot of calendar apps/tools, but I find they are tedious or just don’t work very well or do not actually remind you of an upcoming event.<br>

<br>Description:<br>

<br>The main feature of this app would be that you could automatically grab details from your messages, emails, or whatever apps that you use. This would make it extremely efficient and easy to use. No more forgetting you have, appointments, meetings, or social events. This would make it the most different to most calendar apps as you have to add the event and time in each time you organise something and set up a reminder time. Our app would automatically add it to your calendar and by default would remind you 24hrs beforehand and 8am the morning of this takes out the hassle of always having decide when you want to be reminded. The settings would make it easy to be updated for when you want to be reminded you would be able to choose from a list of options of when to be reminded i.e., 24hrs beforehand or 8am the morning of. These can be changed through the settings function at any time to make it more user friendly. It could also be used to share upcoming events with friends or family and even colleagues.<br>

<br>The app could have a few obstacles which would have to be thoroughly looked at before release. Such has privacy issues when the app would require you to give access to personal information as well as multiple apps that you would use in conjunction with this app. One of the main issues though would be how the app is designed. It needs to be designed well enough from the start up to ensure it is as user friendly as possible. The last thing we would want would be to release the app and the time zone was set differently so then the user turns up late or not at all. The other issue would be making sure that our app is suitable on all platforms and interfaces i.e. Android or Apple so that we don’t limit the potential of widely available we can get our app.

<br>Tools and Technologies:<br>

<br>The main piece of hardware for this project would be an up-to-date computer with a powerful processor and a high amount of RAM besides that to begin with there would not be too much hardware mainly software to use and design. The Automated calendar scheduling app would mainly require coding which we could use open-source material to start such as Python and Mozilla if that is needed for the project. Using open-source code to start would be one of the more efficient ways to get the product up and running as we can see if there is similar code around that we can tailor to the needs of our project.<br>

<br>Skills Required:<br>

<br>There would be multiple skills needed to achieve the desired result which include UI Design and programming skills. Finding the right people for this app design would not be overly difficult as there a lot of people in this field. One of the challenges would be finding the right people who believe in the project. But also keeping costs associated with the app design, hardware, and employees low.
<br>
<br>Outcome:<br>

<br>If the project is successful the app will have achieved its purpose of making it simpler to get reminded of events and get rid of the hassle of adding every event, meeting, or appointment each and every time. This will help take the stress out of thinking you have forgotten an event or help you always run-on time.
